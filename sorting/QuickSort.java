// time complexity of quicksort is n^2 in worst case and the worst case occurs when the pivot is largest or samllest

// For average case the time complexity is nlogn 
// Sometimes quicksort is preferred over merge sort because we don't create an extra array here so it takes 
// less space than merge sort
